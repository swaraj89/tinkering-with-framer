### Overview:

"Tinkering with Framer" is a fun and creative hobby project focused on exploring the exciting world of Framer Motion. This repository serves as a playground where we experiment with creating a dynamic and visually stunning card layout with interactive filters.

### Project Description:

Framer Motion is a powerful animation library that allows us to breathe life into our React components with smooth, fluid animations and intuitive transitions. In this project, we take full advantage of Framer Motion's capabilities to craft an animated card layout that showcases various interactive filters.

### Features:

- Animated card components with stunning entrance and exit transitions.
- Demonstrates best practices for combining Framer Motion with React components.
- Interactive filters to sort and rearrange the cards dynamically.
- Fluid animations that respond to user interactions, providing an engaging user experience.

### Motivation:

The main goal of "Tinkering with Framer" is to learn and share the magic of Framer Motion. By exploring different ways to animate cards and implement interactive filters, we hope to inspire other developers to embrace motion design in their projects and make user interfaces more delightful and enjoyable.
